We have a grpc client in the web app sending location coordinate to the location service, 
then the service passess the message to a kafka queue that writes the data to the database

We would maintain the rest framework for both person and connection services,
 they would get the data from the front end and store in the database. 
 The person and connection service are going to be combined into a single microservice because they both use rest
 and connection service is dependent on person service
