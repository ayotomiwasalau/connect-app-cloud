We could have a grpc client in the web browser or mobile sending location coordinate to the location grpc service, 
then the service passess the message to a kafka queue that passes it to a consumer, this consumer takes the data
and writes it to the psotgres database. But for this project we have a location_grpc_producer_svc\app\client_post.py file that 
we can run to simulate send of the location cordinate to the grpc service.


Secondly, we split the connection and person service into their own microservices. We then have the front end call their endpoints
via REST, then this microservice pull the required data from the database using the ORM - SQLALchemy and returns it
 to the front end whcih displays it on the UI.
